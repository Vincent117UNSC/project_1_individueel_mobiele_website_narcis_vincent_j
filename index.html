            <h2>Skate out of Waste - a tribute to Wasteboards</h2>
                <p>Wasteboards, a small initiative with a factory in Amsterdam, producing handmade skateboards from plastic waste. To be more precise, from plastic bottle caps.</p>
                <p>A good initiative to make sure there will be less plastic waste on our beautiful green planet. It is an all-to-common problem, the amounts of plastic ending up in nature. Wasteboards brings people together, to make sure less of our plastic ends up in nature.</p>
                <p>With the collected plastic bottle caps, Wasteboards creates high quality skateboards, for great skating adventures. They make each board by hand with a variety of colorful bottle cap. Because of that, each board is unique, with its own color patterns.</p>

            <h2>Charity</h2>
                <p>By sourcing plastic bottle caps from charity organizations, Wasteboards does not only recycle plastics for great products, but also supports good causes.</p>
                <p>A lot of the bottle caps are sourced from organizations working with guide dogs. These organizations are the ones who collect the plastic bottle caps, then sell them so the money can be used for training guide dogs for people in need of one.</p>
